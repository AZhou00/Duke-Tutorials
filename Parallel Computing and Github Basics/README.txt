The notes on parallel computing describes how to set up the required environment for parallel computing on a linux system basing on the OPENMPI and mpi4py packages.
In particular, the installation procedure there is aimed to help you set up thenvironment on a LOCAL machine, such as a linux subsystem on your mac, pc, laptop. 
However, setting up the environment on the server should be similiar, and links are provided to help you do this.

Although the set up procedure may be a little different on a real cluster server, the tutorials following the setup guide should be universally applicable to the packages mentioned above.
To use the code provided in the jupyternote book, you should run the magic function %%writefile filename.py in the jupyter cell. This will conveniently write what is in the file to a script.
Then you should open a command prompt running in that directory that contains the script file to call on nodes to do the actual computation.

The github notes are just some quick commands to help you install and use git.

Have fun!
